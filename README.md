# Hypertension medication to meaningful events

## Introduction
Primary care research databases derived from UK electronic health records (EHRs) contain coded prescription information. Much of this information is unstructured or unordered, and interpretation is required to assign clinical meaning to it. 

Here is an algorithm for constructing meaningful prescription events from primary care electronic health records. These events detail the initiation, termination and alteration of antihypertensive therapy, and are useful for further analyses.

## Usage
This setup is for Microsoft Windows and SQL Server, however it could easily be translated to Linus/Mac and MySQL or equivalent.

### Pre-requisites
- Perl
- SQL Server 2008 or higher (or alternative database)

### Execution

```sh
$ execute.bat
```
